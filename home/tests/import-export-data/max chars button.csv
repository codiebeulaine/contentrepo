A miscarriage is when you lose your baby within the first [28] weeks of pregnancy. Most miscarriages happen within the first 3 months.

Signs you may be having a miscarriage are:

‚Ä¢ bleeding that starts light and gets heavier

‚Ä¢ bleeding followed by lower back pain or tummy pain that feels like bad cramps

‚Ä¢ passing blood clots or grey tissue

‚Ä¢ no longer feeling any pregnancy symptoms

Some women will feel severe pain, while for others there will be no pain.

Sometimes a miscarriage happens without the mother knowing it. At the pregnancy check-up the health worker will detect that the baby has no heartbeat.

When you are pregnant it is common to start leaking a bit of wee when you cough, sneeze, run or laugh. This is called urinary incontinence. More than half of pregnant women experience it.

It is most likely to happen in your third trimester, but can happen at any stage of your pregnancy.

It is caused by the hormones that your body produces to let your ligaments and muscles relax and stretch, so you can give birth. This makes your pelvic floor muscles weaker.

The best thing you can do to stop wee from leaking is to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.

These are the muscles around your vagina and bottom (anus) that you use to try and stop yourself from weeing or [passing wind].

*Pelvic floor exercise*
‚Ä¢ Sit down and lean a tiny bit forward with a straight back.

‚Ä¢ Squeeze and lift the muscles around your vagina and your anus like you are trying to stop yourself from weeing or [passing wind].

‚Ä¢ Hold for 5 seconds if you can. (As you get stronger you can hold for longer.)

‚Ä¢ Relax.

‚Ä¢ Repeat 10 to 15 times.

‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt hold your breath or squeeze your bum cheeks (buttocks) while you do these.

Do these exercises 3 to 4 times every day. You can do them while you are watching TV or sitting down to do something else.

Labour starts with your body preparing to give birth.

During early labour your cervix (the opening of the uterus) starts dilating (opening) to allow the baby to be born.

You will feel your tummy tightening and then relaxing. These are early contractions. They may be irregular and far apart but will get closer together and more regular as time goes on.

Having the right people with you during childbirth is important.

When you have a home birth, try to get the support of a professional health worker with medical skills and experience. These are called skilled birth attendants.

The right person will keep you and your baby safe, respect you and your birth plan, and be able to help if there are complications.

Skilled birth attendants include:

A midwife is a specialist in pregnancy, birth and newborn babies. They can look after you while you're pregnant, when you give birth, and after your baby comes.

They can guide and support you during labour and know the danger signs to look out for. If you are at home, they will know if or when you need to go to the hospital for emergency care.

A midwife will also be able to check everything is fine with you and your baby after the baby is born and help you with breastfeeding.

Try kneeling, leaning against a wall or against another person, sitting in a chair or bending down on your hands and knees. Go with what your body tells you. You don‚Äôt need to lie down.

*Focus on your breathing*
Deep, slow breaths can help you relax. Even if you can‚Äôt take deep breaths, try to focus on each breath.

*Create a relaxing space*
Gentle light and calm music can help you feel calmer too. Try to have calm, people with you. This can help too.

*Get into water*
Try having a shower or a warm bath.

*Use warmth*
Put a hot water bottle or heat pack on your back or tummy. Make sure it‚Äôs not too hot.

Also called ‚Äòlaughing gas‚Äô or Entonox, this mixture of gases relaxes you. It makes the pain feel less intense.

You must breathe the gas in before each contraction. It takes about 15 to 20 seconds for it to start working.

The gas might make you feel a bit dizzy, nauseous and make you giggle.

A spinal block is an injection of a local anaesthetic into your back to stop you feeling pain.

You won‚Äôt feel any pain or contractions during the labour, and you will stay awake.

A spinal block is usually quicker to inject and works faster than an epidural. But it doesn‚Äôt last as long, so it‚Äôs better closer to the birth.

After a spinal block, you have to stay in bed and can‚Äôt move around. It can make pushing the baby out more difficult, which means the health team may need to help the baby out.

An epidural is another kind of anaesthetic that stops you feeling pain in your lower body. It is given through a tiny tube that is stuck into your spine.

An epidural takes longer than a spinal block to work, but once it starts working it can keep going as long as you need it. You can also make it stronger if you are still feeling pain.

You may still be able to feel your contractions, but these shouldn‚Äôt be painful.

Sometimes you can move around a bit if you have an epidural, but you will be attached to a pole on wheels.

If you feel a sudden gush or a slow drip of liquid from your vagina, this could be your waters breaking. The liquid should be clear, a bit pink, or slightly bloody, and it won't stop.

Your waters breaking is a natural part of labour. It can be one of the first signs labour is about to start, but it may only happen when your contractions are much stronger.

Your waters are the liquid your baby floats around in inside your uterus (womb). This liquid comes out of your vagina when the sac around your baby breaks open. This usually happens when your body is getting ready to give birth.

Contractions help to move your baby from your tummy into the birth canal (your vagina) and then out into the world.

They can be uncomfortable but aren‚Äôt normally too painful. Usually they stop when you move or change how you're sitting or lying.

The contractions should get longer and the time between them shorter as you get closer to giving birth. At the same time they will get stronger.

As your cervix (the opening to your uterus) opens more and more, you will have contractions every 3 to 5 minutes. Each contraction can last for about a minute. And each one brings you closer to meeting your baby!

Labour starts with your body preparing to give birth. 

During early labour your cervix (the opening of the uterus) starts dilating (opening) to allow the baby to be born.

A C-section is an operation to deliver a baby through a cut in your tummy. 

Often C-sections are done in an emergency, but there are other important reasons for having a planned C-section.

Knowing more about a C-section can help you feel less worried about it.

126,,,mnch_delivery_having_a_csection,,,,,,"*What happens in a C-section?*

If you need a C-section, you will be given an injection (anaesthetic) to make you go numb. 

During the operation, you are awake. You feel some pressure and movement, but you won‚Äôt feel any pain.

The doctor will make a cut across your tummy and lift your baby out into the world. 

Usually after the baby is born and the doctor has checked everything is fine, they put your baby on your chest. If you can, breastfeed your baby immediately.

127,,,mnch_delivery_having_a_csection,,,,,,"*Healing after a C-section*

If you‚Äôve had a C-section, it takes some time to recover. 

You will need to stay in the hospital for a few days until you can sit up and move around. To recover fully it takes most women at least 6 weeks.

The health worker will give you pain medicine and instructions on how to care for the wound (the cut) before you go home. 

If your wound becomes red, swollen or oozes, or if you have a fever after you leave, go back to the clinic.

128,,,mnch_delivery_having_a_csection,,,,,,"*Home recovery tips*

‚Ä¢ Avoid driving or lifting anything heavy until the wound is healed. 

‚Ä¢ Keep your wound clean and dry. Clean and dry it gently. Speak to a health worker if it looks red or feels hot.

‚Ä¢ Take pain medication as your doctor has prescribed. 

‚Ä¢ Stay active by walking. This helps healing and stops blood clots.

‚Ä¢ Eat food with lots of iron and drink plenty of water. Eat fibre to avoid constipation.

‚Ä¢ Talk to someone about your C-section if you need to. It can leave some women feeling sad and upset, especially if it was an emergency.

You can usually breastfeed immediately after a C-section. 

Try different positions, like tucking your baby under your arm or lying on your side. This can be more comfortable and protect your wound.

If you need help, ask the health workers for advice.
