After you give birth, you will have some bleeding for up to 8 weeks. This bleeding is called lochia.

It‚Äôs important to pay attention to your bleeding. Changes in the bleeding can tell you if you're healing well, or if there‚Äôs a problem.

At first, the lochia blood will be heavy and red. It can be like this for up to 10 days. It should get less and less. It will then turn pink, brown, and then yellowish-white.

*When to go to the hospital*
It‚Äôs normal for lochia to change colour, but go to the hospital straight away if:
‚Ä¢ you see large clots (lumps) of blood
‚Ä¢ bleeding gets heavier after the first week
‚Ä¢ you still have bright red bleeding after 7 days

If you need a C-section, you will be given an injection (anaesthetic) to make you go numb. 

During the operation, you are awake. You feel some pressure and movement, but you won‚Äôt feel any pain.

The doctor will make a cut across your tummy and lift your baby out into the world. 

Usually after the baby is born and the doctor has checked everything is fine, they put your baby on your chest. If you can, breastfeed your baby immediately.

If you‚Äôve had a C-section, it takes some time to recover.

The health worker will give you pain medicine and instructions on how to care for the wound (the cut) before you go home.

‚Ä¢ Avoid driving or lifting anything heavy until the wound is healed. 

‚Ä¢ Keep your wound clean and dry. Clean and dry it gently. Speak to a health worker if it looks red or feels hot.

‚Ä¢ Take pain medication as your doctor has prescribed. 

‚Ä¢ Stay active by walking. This helps healing and stops blood clots.

‚Ä¢ Eat food with lots of iron and drink plenty of water. Eat fibre to avoid constipation.

‚Ä¢ Talk to someone about your C-section if you need to. It can leave some women feeling sad and upset, especially if it was an emergency.
